# Back-Propagation-NN
This program shows how work back propagation neural network. But it has some problems with calculation


In file results you save your weights for neural network and also you save minimum and maximum for x and y coordinats.
In program you set n - coefficient of study, d - etalons for 2 outputs.

If you want to study your neural network you have to use study and save functions.

If you want to check another variant you have to use check function.
